# Advent Of Code 2024

My attempt to solve the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles in Scala3.

### Usage

Simply run
```shell
sbt run
```

To reduce boilerplate, the `Main` class will pick the solution class for current day automatically.  
If you want to run a specific solution, provide the day as an argument (`Day1`, `Day2`, etc.):
```shell
sbt run "Day1"
```
